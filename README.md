<h1 align='center'>Alv Boilerplate</h1>

<p align='center'>This is a script template which can be used for FiveM/RedM to help developers create scripts without having to create alot of files and fill in things like a resource manifest each time. It has everything from client -> server files, to discord integrations with pre-written functions (along with framework detection) and even a pre-built UI template in HTML.</p>

<p align='center'>Removing specific files is easy, simply delete them. To avoid warnings, also remove them from the fxmanifest.lua, but this isn't 100% necessary.</p>

<h1 align='center'> Have a suggestion?.</h1>

<p align='center'>
  Whether it be as simple as adding a new language to the locales or updating an actual feature within the script, we appreciate all feedback and try to accomodate to all server owners' needs. <br>
  Therefore, if you have a suggestion please join the Discord linked below at the bottom of this README file and leave your comment in the suggestions channel.

<h1 align='center'> Experienced Developer? Try this!.</h1>

<p align='center'>
  <strong> If you want to have the best performance possible and you understand at least the basics of developing, you could also head to the <code>framework.lua</code> on both the client side and server side, remove all of the code there and add a shared script to the <code>fxmanifest.lua</code> with your frameworks import file, if it supports one. The frameworks in here by default all support imports. This is only really recommended if the resource you're utilising the template for only supports one framework.</strong><br><br>
